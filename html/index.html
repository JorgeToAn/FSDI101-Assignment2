        <h2>Basic info about me</h2>
            <p class="custom-paragraph">My name is Jorge Tostado and I was born on September 24th, 2000 in the city of Mexicali in Baja California, Mexico and currently still is the place where I live.
                Right now I'm studying at the Technological Institute of Mexicali (ITM), specifically, on computer systems engineering.
                I'm actually a very tall person at 190cm (6'3") and pretty skinny as well, I consider myself more of an <ins><sub>introvert</sub></ins> but I don't shut myself off completely from other people, just a <mark>little awkward to talk to complete strangers</mark>.</p>
        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
            <p>Definitely my favorite hobbie of mine is <mark>playing videogames</mark>, ever since I got a GameBoy Advance back when I was little I've been hooked and love videogames dearly. Another kind of similar and recent hobby has been <mark>card games</mark> like <i>Magic the Gathering</i> and <i>YuGiOh!</i> which I have started playing a year ago but mostly through a digital form.</p>
            <p>I also like watching streams on Twitch, series or anime during my free time.</p>
            <p>I have started to read more as well, currently I'm reading <i>Dune</i> which was lent to me by a friend.</p>
        <h2>Misc</h2>
            <h3>My cat Ringo</h3>
                <p>Ringo is a <b>gray-haired</b>, <b>green eyed</b> cat which is about 5 years old, my family and I <b><sup>love</sup></b> him very much even though he leaves his hair all over the house.</p>
